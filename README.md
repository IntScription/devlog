## 🔧 Automation Scripts

The `scripts/` folder contains Python automation tools:

- **`fix_navigation.py`** — Fixes navigation links in all devlog entries
- **`fix_markdownlint.py`** — Automatically corrects markdownlint formatting errors
- **`convert_wikilinks.py`** — Converts Obsidian wiki links (`[[Link]]`) to standard Markdown
- **`add_front_matter.py`** — Adds Jekyll front matter to notes for proper rendering

These scripts run automatically via Git hooks to maintain code quality.
