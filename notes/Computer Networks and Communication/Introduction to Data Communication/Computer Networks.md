# What is  Computer Network ?

- The purpose is that devices can share data
- Connect various homogeneous and heterogeneous devices
-  Sender sends some data / information to the receiver by the help of some connection
- Technically the data sent should be understandable by the receiver, for this there must be some protocol involved
- Protocol are set of instructions (sender sends data but follows some set of instructions)
- Connection can be made sender-receiver or vice-versa
- Protocols produce proper communication

## Network Criteria

### 1. Performance

- Can be measured in many ways, including transit time (amount of time required for a message to travel from one device to another) and response time (it is the elapsed time between an enquiry and a response)
- Depends on number of users, type of transmission medium, capabilities of the connected hardware, and software efficiency
### 2. Reliability

- Measured by frequency  of failure, time it takes to recover from failure, and network robustness
### 3. Security

- Includes protecting data from unauthorised access, protecting data from damage and development, and implementing policies and procedures for recovery from breaches and data loss
