## What is it ?

- It defines the rules that both the sender and receiver and all intermediate devices need to follow to be able to communicate effectively
- Provides communication services where the process is used to exchange messages
- When communication is simple, we use only one protocol
- When communication is complex, we divide the task between different layers

### First Principle

- If we need bidirectional communication, the layer should be in such a way to be able to perform two opposite tasks

### Second Principle

- The two objects in each layer at both sides must be identical
