## Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK)

- Here amplitude is varied keeping frequency and phase constant

### 1. BASK (Binary Amplitude Shift Keying)

- ASK is normally implemented in two levels
- Also known as on-off keying (OOK)

### 2. Multilevel ASK

- Here we can have more than two levels
- It is not implemented with pure ASK, but QAM

## Frequency Shift Keying (FSK)

- Here frequency is varied keeping amplitude and phase constant

### Binary FSK

- We take two carrier frequencies
- First carrier to be 0 and second carrier to be 1

## Phase Shift Keying (PSK)

- Here phase is varied keeping frequency and amplitude constant

### Binary PSK

- We have two signal elements, one with phase of 0° and other with phase of 180°
