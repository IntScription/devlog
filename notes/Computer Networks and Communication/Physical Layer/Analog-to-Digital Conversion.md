## Pulse Code Modulation (PCM)

- Converts analog signal to binary sequence (0 and 1)
- Sampling -> Quantisation -> Coding
- Used for long distance communication
- Efficiency of transmitter is high
- Higher noise immunity is seen
- Used in telephony and compact disks

## Delta Modulation

- Used in transmission of voice information
- Design is simple
- It is a 1-bit quantizer
- Modulator and demodulator can be assigned easily
- Bit rate can be designed by user
