## 3. Error Control

- It can be implemented in the network layer but not preferred
- We add a checksum field 

## 4. Flow Control

- It regulates how much data a source can send without overloading the receiver
- To control the flow of the data, the receiver should send feedback to the sender

## 5. Congestion Control

- Congestion occurs when the number of datagrams sent by the source is beyond the capacity of the network or routers
