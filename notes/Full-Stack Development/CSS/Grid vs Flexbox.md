## **Difference Between Grid and Flexbox:**

### **1. Dimensionality and Flexibility:**

- Flexbox offers greater control over alignment and space distribution between items. Being one-dimensional, Flexbox only deals with either columns or rows.
- Grid has two-dimension layout capabilities which allow flexible widths as a unit of length. This compensates for the limitations in Flex.

### **2. Alignment:**

- Flex Direction allows developers to align elements vertically or horizontally, which is used when developers create and reverse rows or columns.
- CSS Grid deploys fractional measure units for grid fluidity and auto-keyword functionality to automatically adjust columns or rows.

### **3. Item Management**

- Flex Container is the parent element while Flex Item represents the children. The Flex Container can ensure balanced representation by adjusting item dimensions. This allows developers to design for fluctuating screen sizes.
- Grid supports both implicit and explicit content placement. Its inbuilt automation allows it to automatically extend line items and copy values into the new creation from the preceding item.

|**Property**|**Grid**|**Flexbox**|
|---|---|---|
|Dimension|Two – Dimensional|One – Dimensional|
|Features|Can flex combination of items through space-occupying Features|Can push content element to extreme alignment|
|Support Type|Layout First|Content First|

### **Conclusion**

- CSS Grids helps you create the outer layout of the webpage. You can build complex as well responsive design with this. This is why it is called ‘layout first’.
- Flexbox mostly helps align content & move blocks.
- CSS grids are for 2D layouts. It works with both rows and columns.
- Flexbox works better in one dimension only (either rows OR columns).
- It will be more time-saving and helpful if you use both at the same time.
