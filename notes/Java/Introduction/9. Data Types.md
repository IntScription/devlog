## Data types are divided into two groups :

- Primitive data types
- Non-Primitive data types

### Primitive Data Types

This data type specifies the size and type of variable values, and it has no additional methods.

There are eight primitive data types :

| Data Type | Size    | Description                                                                       |
| --------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| byte      | 1 byte  | Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127                                             |
| short     | 2 bytes | Stores  whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767                                      |
| int       | 4 bytes | Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,648                         |
| long      | 8 bytes | Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 |
| float     | 4 bytes | Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits           |
| double    | 8 bytes | Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal deigits              |
| boolean   | 1 bit   | Stores true or false values                                                       |
| char      | 2 bytes | Stores a single character/letter or ASCII values                                  |

### Non-Primitive Data Types

(Also known as Reference Types)
- String
- Arrays
- Classes

## Float or Double ?

The **precision** of a floating point value indicates how many digits the value can have after the decimal point. The precision of `float` is only six or seven decimal digits, while `double` variables have a precision of about 15 digits. Therefore it is safer to use `double` for most calculations.

## Boolean Types

- YES / NO
- TRUE / FALSE
- ON / OFF
- This is used for conditional testing

## Character Types

- Used to store single character
- Surrounded by single-quotes `''`
