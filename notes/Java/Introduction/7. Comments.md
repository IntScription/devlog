-  Used to explain a code and make it more readable
- Used to prevent execution while testing alternate code

### Single-line Comments

- Start with two forward slashes `//`
- Technically for short comments

```Java
public class test(){
  public static void main(String[] args){
    System.out.println(5 + 6); // The output will be 11
  }
}
```

### Multi-line Comments

- Starts with `/*` and ends with `*/`
- Any text between these will be ignored
- Technically for long comments

```Java
public class text(){
  public static void main(String[] args){
    /* This is a long comment which will mostly likely go to       the next line fo don' be mad if it does cause seriously       its a long comment..haha */
    System.out.println("LONG COMMMENT..LET'S GOOO");
  }
}
```
