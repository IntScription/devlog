## Three step process that gives us feedback

1. *Edit* your program
      - Create it by typing text on our keyboard
      - Eventually we get a text file (Eg : <mark>Helloworld.java</mark>)
2. *Compile* the program to create an executable file
      - Here we use a java compiler so it technically creates a java byte-code file (Eg : <mark>Helloworld.class</mark>)
      - If there is a mistake the compiler tells us so and then we go back to Step 1 and fix things (mainly : <u>Recompile</u>)
3.  *Run* our program
      Eg :`java Helloworld.java`
       - There may be errors sometimes in which we must Recompile again
