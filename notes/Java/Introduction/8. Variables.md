- `String` - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes
- `int` - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
- `float` - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
- `char` - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
- `boolean` - stores values with two states: true or false

## Declaring a variable

`type variableName = value;`

- Here, '=' is used to assign values to the variables

### Identifiers

- All Java variables must be identified with unique names
- Mostly can be short names but preferred descriptive names for understandability and to maintain code

>[! Rules for variables]
>- Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs
>- Names must begin with a letter
>- Names should start with a lowercase letter and it cannot contain whitespace
>- Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
>- Names are case sensitive ("myVar" and "myvar" are different variables)
>- Reserved words (like Java keywords, such as `int` or `boolean`) cannot be used as names
