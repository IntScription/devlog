- Every line of code in Java must be inside a `class` 
- A class should always start with an uppercase letter
- Java is case-sensitive
- The name of Java file must match the class name
- Save the file with `.java` in the end

## Main

- The main is required :

     ```Java
  public static void main(String args[])
```

- Every program contains a main

## System.out.println()

- Used inside the main method

```Java
public static void main(String[] args){
   System.out.println("Hello World");
}
```

##  println()

- Used to output or print text
- When using text we should use double-quotes `""` 
- Adds a new-line after every output making it more systematic to read

- [X] System.out.println("Say it..")
- [ ] ==System.out.println(This will produce an error !)

## print()

- Here it does not insert a new-line after every output

```Java
System.out.print("Hello");
```
