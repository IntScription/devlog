# Devlog - 2025-09-15

## 🚀 What I Did

- Learned Arrays.

## 🧠 What I Learned

### Arrays

- Collections of elements of the same type stored in contiguous memory.
- Fixed size (cannot grow/shrink once created).

### Enhanced For-Loops

- Also called "for-each loop".
- Introduced in Java 5.
- It’s a shorter, cleaner way to loop through arrays or collections.

```Java
for (datatype variable : collection) {
    // use variable
}
```

- `datatype` → type of elements (e.g., int, String, double)
- `variable` → temporary name for each element
- `collection` → array or a class implementing Iterable (like ArrayList, HashSet)

## 🔥 What's Next

- Further practicing arrays.
- Strings
- Some coding related to the above topics.
