# Devlog - 2025-11-18

## 🚀 What I Did

- Codewars.
- Sentence analyzer.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- A break statement is used to exit a loop early, while a continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next one.
- while loop checks condition first then iterates the code.
- do while does the opposite of while.

## 🔥 What's Next

- Some more into loops.
- Codewars as usual.
