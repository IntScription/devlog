# Devlog - 2025-10-29

## 🚀 What I Did

- Email masker.
- Calculator.
- Loan Qualification Checker.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Functions are reusable pieces of code that perform a specific task or calculate a value.

```javascript
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello, Jessica!");
}
```

- By default the return value in function is undefined.

```javascript
// Arrow function
const greetings = (name) => {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
};
```

## 🔥 What's Next

- Some mini projects.
