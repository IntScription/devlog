# Devlog - 2025-10-08

## 🚀 What I Did

- House Painting.

## 🧠 What I Learned

### `z-index`

- Control the vertical stacking order of positioned elements that overlap on the page.
- Works on elements that are positioned.
- Position - static, relative, absolute or fixed.
- Default value is `auto`.

```css
.box1 {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 1;
  background: lightcoral;
  top: 20px;
  left: 20px;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
}

.box2 {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 3;
  background: gold;
  top: 40px;
  left: 40px;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
}
```
