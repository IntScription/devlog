### Computer Basics

- Motherboard – main circuit board, connects all components.
- CPU – executes instructions, does calculations.
- RAM – temporary memory for active processes.
- HDD – permanent storage (slower).
- SSD – faster, flash-based permanent storage.
- PSU – converts wall power for computer.
- GPU – renders visuals/graphics.

### Internet Basics

- ISP – company providing internet (dial-up, DSL, cable, fiber, satellite).
- Safe Sign-in – strong password, 2FA, password manager.

### Developer Tools

- IDE – write, test, debug code in one place.
- Code Editor – lightweight tool to write/debug code.
- Git – version control for tracking/collaboration.
- Repo Hosting – GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket.
- Package Managers – handle dependencies (npm, pip, Maven).
- Testing – ensures code works (Jest, PHPUnit, JUnit).

### File Formats

- Naming – use descriptive names (about-us.html).
- Root Directory – top-level folder.
- Markdown – simple markup for docs (README).
- index.html – default website page.
- File Managers – Explorer (Windows), Finder (Mac).
- Search – built-in file search.

### File Types

- HTML (.html), CSS (.css), JS (.js)
- Images: JPEG, PNG, GIF, SVG
- Audio/Video: MP3, MP4, MOV
- Fonts: TTF, WOFF, WOFF2
- ZIP: compressed files

### Web Browsing

- Browser – software to access websites (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- Search Engine – find info online (Google, Bing, Yahoo).

### Search Tricks

- site:example.com → search inside a site
- filetype:pdf → search file types
- -term → exclude results
- +term → must include term

- CSS is made up of two parts selecter and a declaration block.

```css
selector {
  property: value;
}
```

### CSS ways to apply

- `inline` - for overriding styles quickly on a single element.
- `internal` - best suited for applying styles to a single webpage only.
- `external` - It promotes separation of concerns and reusability across multiple pages.

### Combinators

- Child combinator (`>`) - used to select elements that are direct children of a specified parent element.
- Next-sibling combinator (`+`) - selects an element that immediately follows a specified sibling element.
- Subsequent-sibling combinator (`~`) - selects all siblings of a specified element that come after it.

- `margin` - create space between the border of an element and its neighboring elements.
- `padding` - create space between the content of an element and its border.

## 🔥 What's Next

- CSS and Java.
