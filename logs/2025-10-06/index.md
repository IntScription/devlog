# Devlog - 2025-10-06

## 🚀 What I Did

- Contact Details form.
- Confidential Email page.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- `appearance: none` on `input` - improving the security of form submissions.
- `appearance: none` - Browsers apply default styling to a lot of elements.
- The input format is different across browsers.
- WebKit - it is a browser engine that displays webpages.

### `overflow-y`

```css
div {
  overflow-y: hidden;
}
```

- Overflow - When content exceeds the size of its containing element.
- Vertical overflow is generally considered more acceptable in web design.
- Margin collapsing occur in the vertical margin only.
- `content-box` - default value for `box-sizing`.

## 🔥 What's Next

- CSS advance.
