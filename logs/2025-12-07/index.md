# Devlog - 2025-12-07

## 🚀 What I Did

- Build you own shell(codecrafters - still in progress.)

## 🧠 What I Learned

### REPL

A REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) is an interactive loop that forms the core of a shell. It follows a repeating cycle:

- Read: Display a prompt and wait for user input
- Eval: Parse and execute the command
- Print: Display the output or error message
- Loop: Return to step 1 and wait for the next command

## 🔥 What's Next

- codewars.
- theory.
- FCC.
