# Devlog - 2025-07-18

## ðŸš€ What I Did
- Had some fun on MonkeyType(like got 72 with 98% accuracy - not great score but getting there).
- Used ChatGpt to get some info on different devlog options:

```text
 | Purpose           | Platform               |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| Quick updates     | X / Threads            |
| Short visual logs | YouTube Shorts         |
| Detailed logs     | YouTube Longform, Blog |
| Community         | Discord, IndieHackers  |
| Portfolio Proof   | GitHub / Notion        |
| Monetize          | Newsletter / Medium    |
```

  ## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- Did some updates to my person-website(it is a practice one)
- Added unordered list(ul)
- Also I'm using Scrimba(fullstack path) just to get a revision on the topics; it's been a long time so I need some practice.
- Added css and js files which played a good role in enhancement.
- Well we do know: html - bones, css - muscles & fibres and js - is the brain.

## ðŸ”¥ What's Next
- CS50 Harvard
- Data Structures
- Algorithms
