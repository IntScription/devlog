# Devlog - 2025-07-18

## ðŸš€ What I Did
- Had some fun on MonkeyType(like got 72 with 98% accuracy - not great score but getting there).
- Used ChatGpt to get some info on different devlog options:

|  Purpose          | Platform               |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| Quick updates     | X / Threads            |
| Short visual logs | YouTube Shorts         |
| Detailed logs     | YouTube Longform, Blog |
| Community         | Discord, IndieHackers  |
| Portfolio Proof   | GitHub / Notion        |
| Monetize          | Newsletter / Medium    |

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- Updated my **personal website** (practice project).
- Revisited **unordered lists (ul)**.
- Using **Scrimba (Full-Stack path)** for revision after a long break.
- Added **CSS and JS files**, which improved the site's functionality.
- Fun analogy reminder:
  **HTML** â†’ bones
  **CSS** â†’ muscles & fibres
  **JS** â†’ brain
