# Devlog - 2025-07-18

## 🚀 What I Did

- Had some fun on MonkeyType (like got 72 with 98% accuracy — not great score
  but getting there).

- Used ChatGPT to get some info on different devlog options:

| Purpose          | Platform               |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| Quick updates     | X / Threads            |
| Short visual logs | YouTube Shorts         |
| Detailed logs     | YouTube Longform, Blog |
| Community         | Discord, IndieHackers  |
| Portfolio Proof   | GitHub / Notion        |
| Monetize          | Newsletter / Medium    |

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Updated my **personal website** (practice project).
- Revisited **unordered lists (ul)**.
- Using **Scrimba (Full-Stack path)** for revision after a long break.
- Added **CSS and JS files**, which improved the site's functionality.
- Fun analogy reminder:
  **HTML** → bones
  **CSS** → muscles & fibres
  **JS** → brain

## 🔥 What's Next

- CS50 Harvard
- Data Structures
- Algorithms
