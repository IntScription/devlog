# Devlog - 2025-10-12

## üöÄ What I Did

- Newspaper Layout using Grids.
- Moon Orbit.

## üß† What I Learned

| Feature              | Explicit Grid                                                              | Implicit Grid                                                                  |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Size control**     | Fully customizable using `grid-template-rows` and `grid-template-columns`. | Controlled by `grid-auto-rows` and `grid-auto-columns`, or defaults to `auto`. |
| **Default Behavior** | Does not change unless explicitly defined.                                 | Automatically adapts to items placed outside the explicit grid.                |
| **Complexity**       | Requires more planning for layout structure.                               | Easier to implement for unstructured or variable content.                      |
| **Flexibility**      | Rigid structure with defined rows and columns.                             | Flexible and adapts to dynamically placed content.                             |
| **Performance**      | Potentially more performant as the layout is predefined.                   | May require additional browser computations for implicit grid generation.      |
| **Use case**         | Useful when the grid structure is predictable and defined upfront.         | Useful for dynamic layouts where content is unknown or changes frequently.     |

### Grids

- A two-dimensional layout for HTML documents.
- `@keyframes` - To define the stages and styles of the animation.

## üî• What's Next

- JavaScript.
