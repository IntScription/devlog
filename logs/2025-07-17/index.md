# Devlog - 2025-07-17

## ðŸš€ What I Did
- Started with CS50(Computer Science course by Harvard).
- Helped me on the revision for C-language.
- This time tried to run the code on the terminal itself.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void){
    printf("Hello, world.\n");
    return 0;
}
```

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- It was simple but I wanted to understand the teminal workflow.
- For compiling and running together, `gcc hello.c -o hello && ./hello`. 

## ðŸ”¥ What's Next
- I'll work on full-stack. ; like the topic then what I did, what I learned and whats next.
