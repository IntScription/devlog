## 🧠 What I Learned

### Attribute Selector

- Used to target html based on their attributes.

```css
a[href] {
  color: blue;
  text-decoration: underline;
}
```

#### Type attribute

`type` attribute can be set on an ol (ordered list).

- 1 for numerical lists (such as 1, 2, 3, ...).
- A for uppercase alphabetical lists (such as A, B, C, ...).
- a for lowercase alphabetical lists (such as a, b, c, ...).
- I for uppercase Roman numerals (such as I, II, III, ...).
- i for lowercase Roman numerals (such as i, ii, iii, ...).
