# Devlog - 2025-09-14

## 🚀 What I Did

- Made a Travel Page website.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Figure element in html.

```html
<figure>
  <img src="https//...." />
  <figcaption>Example image</figcaption>
</figure>
```

- Audio element:

```html
<audio
  src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/js-music-player/can't-stay-down.mp3"
  loop
  controls
  muted
></audio>```

- Audio controls:

```html
<audio controls>
  <source src="audio.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
  <source src="audio.wav" type="audio/wav" />
  <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
</audio>
```

- Video controls:

```html
<video
  src="https://archive.org/download/BigBuckBunny_124/Content/big_buck_bunny_720p_surround.mp4"
  loop
  controls
  muted
  poster="https://peach.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/title_anouncement.jpg?x11217"
  width="620"
></video>
```

- `controls` attribute - enables users to manage audio playback, including adjusting volume, and pausing, or resuming playback.
- `poster` attribute - To display an image while the video is downloading.
- Scaling/Sizing of images should be the same scale as the rendered size on the page.
- WEBP/GIF/PNG - This format is not lossless, so compressing it would result in a degraded quality.
- You should never compress to JPG format.

## 🔥 What's Next

- Practicing Java and theory.
