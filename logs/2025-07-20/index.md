# Devlog - 2025-07-20

## 🚀 What I Did
- Sadly, not much today.
- Went on Polymarket to do some trades.
- Since it's my first time I am playing carefully.
- Also I did some changes to the Devlog page.
- Yes, I said no styling but it bothered me yesterday so I added some styling.
- Corrected repeated 'Connect with me' on the GitHub pages.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- JS DOM manipulation.
- Gradients and tables through css.

## 🔥 What's Next
- Definitely should start DS and Algos.. haha.
