# Devlog - 2025-10-23

## 🚀 What I Did

- String Transformer.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- ASCII encoding helps for manipulation using numbers.
- `includes()` - used to check if a sting contains a specific substring.
- The above method is case-sensitive.
- Trim - used to trim white-spaces from start and end of string.
- `replace()` - handles first occurrence of the search value.
- `repeat()` - allows you to repeat a string a specified nos of times.

```javascript
let word = "Hello!";
let repeatedWord = word.repeat(3);
console.log(repeatedWord);  // Output: "Hello!Hello!Hello!"
```

## 🔥 What's Next

- Boolean and Numbers.
