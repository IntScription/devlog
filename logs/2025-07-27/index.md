# Devlog - 2025-07-27

## 🚀 What I Did
- Harvard CS50 rivision.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Data types(Eg: int, float, char, long, double, etc).
- Basic 'hello world' program again. Used `\n - for new line`.
- In C programming, you have to `make` whenever there is a change.
- Also include libraries in the beginning, `#include <stdio.h> and many more depending on the type of library you want to use`.
- Placeholder is used for dynamic interaction, `%i for integer and %s for string`.


## 🔥 What's Next
- Little revision on Scrimba and some mini projects if I think of any.
